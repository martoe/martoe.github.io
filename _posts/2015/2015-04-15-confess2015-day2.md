### Run Java applications with Docker on the Raspberry Pi and other platforms
by *Johan Janssen* of InfoSupport

A short introduction to docker and a step-by-step receipt how to get docker running on a Raspberry Pi

* the whole development infrastructure can be docker-ized:  target environment (application servers and databases at different stages), Jenkins, Sonar, SCM server...
* use separate containers for each service (Appserver, database,...)
* use separate containers for application and data
* use a (private) docker registry
* keep environment settings (for different stages) separate


### Maintain your Maintainability
by *Bernhard Keprt* of willhaben.at

Desirable properties of a maintainable application:

* isolated components
* resilience
* code changeable without sideeffects
* understandable code

Architectural patterns:

* Bulkhead, circuit breaker (e.g. Hystrix)
* Client-side load balancing (e.g. Ribbon)
* Logic load balancing: separate resources for low-prio components (e.g. batch jobs, statistical services) physically from business-critical components
* Microservices (single components may be replaced more easily)

Hosted code quality services:
* ...

* [Versioneye](https://www.versioneye.com/)


### Metaprogramming with Groovy
by *Iván López Martín* of Kaleidos

* Intercepting methods (using GroovyInterceptable)
* Injecting methods and properties (using MetaClass)
* Categories: modifying metaclasses only within a block
* Extension modules: enhance classes by putting a JAR file (with class extensions) onto the classpath
* Mixins (deprecated), Traits
* Method syntesis ("create, cache, execute")

### Real-World RESTful Service Development Problems and Solutions
by *Masoud Kalali* of Oracle

* Content negotiation
* Resource versioning
* Validation - always include a domain-specific error code in an error response 
* Exception handling - never send back stacktraces! Use ExceptionMappers as last line of defense
* Logging - use a correlation ID
* Authentication, access control
* Caching (RestEasy: @Cache, @NoCache)
* Partial updates (PUT/POST/PATCH)
* Long-running jobs
