<p>A few notes while working through this book (excellent stuff so far):</p><p>&#8211; work in progress &#8211;</p><ul>  <li>The very same model should be used during all project phases (analysis, design, implementation) (Ch.3)</li>  <li>Use a layered architecture with a thin service layer (Ch.4)</li>  <li>Subsystem break-up: First, use horizontal segmentation (layers), then divide the domain layer in vertical segments</li>  <li>Avoid getters and Setters on domain objects (see <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html">A. Holub</a>)</li>  <li>Use as few associations as possible (p82ff)</li>  <li>Group similar entity attributes as value objects (p97ff)</li>  <li>Aggregates (p125ff): Entities insied the aggregate have only a local identity. Foreign entities must only reference the aggregate root.</li></ul><div class="item_footer"><p><small><a href="http://bxm.at/blogs/java/eric-evans-domain-driven-design">Original post</a> blogged on <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>
