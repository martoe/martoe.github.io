* [Get a Taste of Lambdas and Get Addicted to Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OpAgZvYXLQ) by Venkat Subramaniam (04/2017)
    * Lambda expressions should be clue code. Two lines may be too many
    * Funny quotes:
        * the reason why programmers are antisocial -> 01:03
        * "...the person that uses all the tools is called a consultant" 01:07
* [Join my war on ClassLoader leaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXqIfo5h2BE) by Mattias Jiderhamn (05/2018)
    * How does the classloader (and GC) basically work
    * What causes memory issues on redeployments and what can be done against it

# Architecture

### Microservices

* [Microservices, Monoliths, and Modularity](https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/microservices-monoliths-and-modularity/) (07/2017)
    * Don't use microservices to force modularization of a monolith
* [Self Contained Systems: Microservices Done Right](https://www.infoq.com/articles/scs-microservices-done-right) (07/2017)
    * Bounded contexts (not domain/data objects!) as starting point for modularization
* [On Monoliths and Microservices](https://dev.otto.de/2015/09/30/on-monoliths-and-microservices/) (02/2018)
    * Why moving from a monolith to microservices?
    * Despription of a modular architecture


# Design/Clean Code

* [Kent Becks Rules for Simple Design](http://wiki.c2.com/?XpSimplicityRules) (09/2017, via Venkat - eJUG)
    * The Code (ordered by priority)...
        * ...passes all tests
        * ...reveals its intetions
        * ...doesn't contain duplications
        * ...has only minimal methods, classes etc.
