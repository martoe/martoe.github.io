    * Don't use microservices to force modularization of a monolith
* [Self Contained Systems: Microservices Done Right](https://www.infoq.com/articles/scs-microservices-done-right) (07/2017)
    * Bounded contexts (not domain/data objects!) as starting point for modularization
* [On Monoliths and Microservices](https://dev.otto.de/2015/09/30/on-monoliths-and-microservices/) (02/2018)

# Design/Clean Code

* [Kent Becks Rules for Simple Design](http://wiki.c2.com/?XpSimplicityRules) (09/2017, via Venkat - eJUG)
    * The Code (ordered by priority)...
        * ...passes all tests
        * ...reveals its intetions
        * ...doesn't contain duplications
        * ...has only minimal methods, classes etc.
