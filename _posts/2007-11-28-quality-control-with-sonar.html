<p><a href="http://sonar.hortis.ch/">Sonar</a> is a free tool that sets up a quality control website for a Maven project.</p><p>The cool thing is that you don&#8217;t have to deal with reporting plugins, just start the Sonar server, add the Sonar plugin to your pom.xml, and start the Maven build.<br />The project then appears on the website with a lot of quality-related metrics (like code coverage, cyclomatic complexity&#8230;)</p><div class="item_footer"><p><small><a href="http://bxm.at/blogs/java/sonar">Original post</a> blogged on <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>
