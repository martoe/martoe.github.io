My session notes from first day of the [Confess 2015](http://2015.con-fess.com/) conference...

### Keynote: One VM to Rule Them All
by Thomas Wuerthinger of Oracle

Thomas talks about an ongoing research project at Oracle: It aims that dynamic languages at the VM should be as fast as static typed languages (in orders of magnitude).

### Introducing Spring Cloud
by Agim Emruli of Mimacom

[Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) is a "Toolbox for distributes applications".
You might want to use it if you have...

* multiple deployments per day
* a microservice architecture
* a distributed system

Some components:

* [Spring Cloud Config](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) to publish your (SCM-managed) configuration (reconfigure the running application by "git push")
* [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix) - integration of (some) [Netflix OSS projects](http://netflix.github.io/), like
    * Hystrix (circuit breaker)
    * Eureka (service discovery)
    * Ribbon (client-side load balancing)
    * Zool ("reverse proxy" for using the service registry by direct browser access)
* Support for [AWS](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-aws), CloudFoundry,...

### From Zero To Hero with Spring Boot
by Stéphane Nicoll of Pivotal

A coding session that shows how to get started with Spring Boot.
* Starting point: [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io/) or IDE integration
* [Spring Actuator](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/) for management REST endpoints


### Modern Enterprise Java Architectures with Spring 4.1
by Jürgen Höller of Pivotal

Status quo (overview) of the Spring component model (updated version of a talk that Jürgen gave some time ago at the eJUG in Linz)


### ELK - BigData for DevOps
by Maarten Mulders of ING

A (mostly theoretical) introduction to [Logstash](http://logstash.net/), [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch), and [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) (case study from ING bank).


### The Walking Dead - A survival guide to resilient applications
by Michael Nitschinger of Couchbase

Design considerations for resilient applications:

* finding the right "Units of mitigation" (units that handle/recover from errors by themselves)
* Escalation (if a "unit of mitigation" cannot handle an error by itself, propagate the error to the calling component)
* different types of redundancy
* always use timeouts! (always! on every system border!)
* use "intelligent" retries (number of retries, time between them)
* Fail fast

Patterns:

* Fault observer (instead of just passive logging)
* Leaky bucket counter (instead of treating every error as failure)
* Bounded queues, ring buffers (to prevent from long waiting)
* Circuit breaker (see points below), e.g. Hystrix

Monitoring:

* Turbine (Netflix)


### Empowering EE-6 and 7 with Apache DeltaSpike
by Mark Struberg

Nice introduction to CDI and CDI-extensions.
CDI may also be used in JavaSE (i.e. outside an application server), and [DeltaSpike](https://deltaspike.apache.org/) provides a nice set of extensions, similar to some SPring features:

* [Core](https://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/core.html)
* [Configuration](http://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/configuration.html): configure WARs, EARs for different environments without modifying them
* [CdiCtrl](https://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/container-control.html) to start and stop CDI containers, e.g. for unit tests
* [CdiTestRunner](http://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/test-control.html)
* [JPA](http://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/jpa.html): implementation of `@Transactional`, similar to EJBs. Differences to EJB:
    * rollback on every exception (not just on runtime exceptions)
    * rollback a transaction only at the outermost level (instead of killing the current transaction if a nested transactional call has thrown an exception)
* also: Data, Security, JSF...


### Anatomy of Microservice Landscapes
by Michael Plöd

Michael's talk is about considerations and challenges when planning to introduce a microservice architectural:

SOA has produced big monolithic applications (with less service reuse than expected)
Microservices (defined as "small", "autonomous", and "collaborative") are complex and distributed, they are "no free lunch".

* Business design, modularization. Do you really need a n-tier layer design?
* Interface design (synchronous orchestration vs. asynchronous choreography)
* Deployment: loose coupling! DevOps! A fully automated deployment infrastructure is crucial!
* Collaboration (best practice: one service per host/container)
* Resilience (error conditions are complex and will happen more often. Prefer "rolling forward" when dealing with error conditions, use bulkheads, use circuit breakers)
* Monitoring (consolidate logs, identify unique requests)

Required infrastructure components:
* Message broker (a lightweight one, e.g. RabbitMQ)
* Service registry (Eureka, Zookeeper,...)
