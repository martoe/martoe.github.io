<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.zero2hero.at/">Zero2Hero</a> organized two Git workshops in Vienna with <a href="http://timberglund.com/">Tim Berglund</a> as trainer. I already worked through the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920017462.do">Mastering Git</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024774.do">Mastering Advanced Git</a> videos in the past (which I can highly recommend), so I didn’t expect great news here, but I didn’t wanted to miss the opportunity to meet Tim in person, so I booked the <a href="http://www.zero2hero.at/gitfromzero2hero/advanced/">Advanced training</a> – and I didn’t regret it!</p> <p>So, here is my unsorted list of things I have learned (see also the <a href="http://teach.github.com/classnotes/2013-05-22-zero2hero-vienna-advanced-workshop.html">shownotes</a>):</p> <ul> <li>“git config --global credential.helper cache” <strong>caches the credentials</strong> for https authentication (default 15min)  <li>I have never used <strong>patch-mode adding</strong> (the “-p” option) yet, but I will try it soon (sadly <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> doesn’t support it, but people say that e.g. <a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> does). The “-p” option also works with “checkout” and “reset”.  <li>When <strong>rebasing</strong>, “git reflog” is your friend to find messed-up commits. To squash a whole branch, “git merge --squash [branchname]” is an alternative to interactive rebasing (but the merged branch must be forced-deleted afterwards)  <li>A possible way of <strong>undoing</strong> the last command is “git reset --hard HEAD@{1}” (move up the reflog)  <li>We were using <a href="http://www.perforce.com/downloads/free/p4merge">p4merge</a> as external <strong>diff/mergetool</strong> (a powerful, but expensive alternative is <a href="http://www.araxis.com/">Araxis</a>)  <li>Use “git fetch --prune” as replacement for “git remote prune origin”  <li>Use "git log -S [sometext]" find commits that introduced a given text</li></ul> <p>When discussing Git workflows, Tim stated that "<a href="https://www.google.at/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnvie%2Fgitflow&amp;ei=whyiUaOmNYfkOvudgPAN&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5ZTMyhdMg52iAhANXSvWaZbb2aQ&amp;sig2=Js-O2LnOPsksHpqd3eJmNw&amp;bvm=bv.47008514,d.ZWU">Gitflow</a> has too much opinions about the release process". He suggested to build your own development/release process based on Git, instead of using other’s biases.<br></p> <p>Some participants (especially those who also booked the beginners training a day earlier) complained that the pace of the training was too fast and hard to follow, but I don’t agree: this was an “advanced” class, and for me the pace was very modest (and I am anything but a Git expert).</p>
