<p>Such a simple task:</p><p><em>Create a method cache so that a given method is only executed once per day, and further requests return the cached result.</em></p><p>Since I won&#8217;t pollute my method with caching code, I would like some &#8220;aspect-oriented&#8221; solution, so all I would have to do is annotate my method ("@Cacheable&#8221; or such).<br />The current project setup includes <a href="http://ehcache.org/">Ehcache</a> and the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/documentation">Spring Framework</a>, so that&#8217;s a piece of cake&#8230;</p><p>&#8230;or maybe it isn&#8217;t? Let&#8217;s check the alternatives:</p><ul><li><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.0.M2/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html">Spring annotation-based caching</a> is only available since Spring 3.1, which is not released yet (we are currently using version 3.0.5)</li><li>The former <a href="http://java.net/projects/springmodules">Spring-Modules</a> project did include this feature, but it is dead for years and only works with Spring 2.x</li><li>Ehcache <a href="http://ehcache.org/recipes/spring-annotations.html">recommends</a> the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ehcache-spring-annotations/">Ehcache-Spring-Annotations</a> project, which requires Ehcache 2.x - but we are currently using version 1.5 (which is bundled with the current Hibernate release)</li></ul><p>So it seems that there is no out-of-the-box solution for our configuration :-(<br />The only remaining option is</p><ul><li>do it yourself, like e.g. <a href="http://www.briandupreez.net/2010/06/spring-aspectj-ehcache-method-caching.html">this guy</a></li></ul><div class="item_footer"><p><small><a href="http://bxm.at/blogs/java/method-caching-with-ehcache-and-spring">Original post</a> blogged on <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>
