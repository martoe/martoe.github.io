A collection of various quotations, idioms, and aphorisms - not exclusively related to software development, and not to be taken 100 percent seriously ;-)

## Boehm's First Law

Errors are most frequent during the requirements and design activities and are the more expensive the later they are removed.

## Clarke's laws
   
1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
