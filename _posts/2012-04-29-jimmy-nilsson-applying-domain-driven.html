I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202/">"Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns"</a> based on a recommendation from <a href="http://www.gernotstarke.de/">Gernot Starke</a> at his WJAX-Session. I expected to get some new ideas regarding “domain model development” (in the most general sense).<br /><br />To cut it short, for me this book was a loss.<br /><br />There is a simple test to check whether or not this book may be something for you:<br /><ul><li>Do you have deep Java expericence?</li><li>Are you familiar with Design Patterns?</li><li>Do you know about Domain-Driven Design? </li></ul>If you can answer more than one question with "yes", don't buy this book because you are probably over-qualified.<br /><br />The book is split into four parts (five actually, if you count in the appendices), which I want to summarize here:<br /><br /><h3>  Part 1: Background</h3>Should be entitled “Object Orientation for Beginners” – Nilsson mainly explains basic terms like “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612">GoF patterns</a>”, “<a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">test-driven development</a>”, or “<a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/118">layered architecture</a>”.<br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Well, he admits (e.g. on page 13) that there is a huge gap between the “Microsoft world” and the “Java world” regarding these topics (he probably would skip these chapters if he was targeting Java developers), but I really expected something more than just rewriting stuff that should be commonsense for 10 years.</span><br /><br /><h3>  Part 2: Applying DDD</h3>About building a domain model&nbsp; - it is the strongest part of the book (especially chapter 7), but it contains nothing substancially new if you have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/">Eric Evan's book</a>.<br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">One thing that I never thought of in great detail: The internal state of a domain object has nothing to do with persistence! So a domain object can be “functional valid” regarding business rules, and “technical valid” (which means it can be persisted); but these two concerns should not be mixed up.</span><br /><br /><h3>  Part 3: Applying PoEAA</h3>An introduction to O/R mappers. (Yep, that's all. If&nbsp; you ever worked with <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>, you may safely skip this part).<br /><br /><h3>  Part 4: What's Next?</h3>An introduction to SOA, dependency injection, AOP, and some GUI patterns - it has no real connection to the other parts of the book.<br /><br />
