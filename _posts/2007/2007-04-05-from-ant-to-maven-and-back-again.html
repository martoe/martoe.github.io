<p>Just to remember:<br />Next time I think about switching the build process of a huge project from Ant to Maven, I will first read <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/zarar/archive/2006/12/the_pain_of_mig_1.html">Zarar Siddiqi's blog</a> and then never, ever have any doubts about my (awful but working) Ant scripts again. Never touch a running system, buster.</p><p>That said: I would never again start a project from scratch <strong>without</strong> Maven.</p><div class="item_footer"><p><small><a href="http://bxm.at/blogs/java/from_ant_to_maven_and_back_again">Original post</a> blogged on <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>.</small></p></div>
